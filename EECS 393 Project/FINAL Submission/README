README

Thanks for taking the time to grade our project, here are a few things you need to know:

*******IMPORTANT*******

This project requires you to have brew and cocoa pods installed.
For brew, please visit:
https://brew.sh/
For cocoapods install, please visit:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20755044/how-to-install-cocoapods
For cocoapods setup, please run the following line in Terminal:
pod install

Please reach out to us if you have problems running!!!

When you open the source code folder, please use Xcode and open the file:
SocialGamingPlatform.xcworkspace
not the xcodeproj file.


The app might be logged in because you might have logged in before.
When you start our app and it is already logged in, please go to the Account tab and logout.
If you are on the Login page, please use the following credentials to login (Case-sensitive):

Account name: eecs393@case.edu
Password: eecs393

The reason for this setup is to ensure you log in with an account that has a lot of points so that
you can test all our functions (buy games, powerups, levelups, etc)

Notes:
If you are planning to test our project on an actual iOS device, we would highly recommend
iPhoneX or iPhoneXS since our project is based on that.
This app might only work on iOS 10.0 or after.

Please contact us if you have any trouble. Thank you!
